MASTERMIND

by Trey Weldon

The goal of the game is to crack the secret code in 10 attempts or less. A black peg is returned for each guess that is a correct color and also in the correct location. A white peg is returned for each guess that is a correct color, but in the wrong location. The order of the pegs does not necessarily correlate with the secret code. The secret code may or may not have multiples of certain colors, so don't rule that out as a possibility.

GETTING STARTED 

 https://treyweldon.github.io/mastermind/

In order to make your guess, select your answer by clicking on the desired color in the bank. Your selection will be added to the guess row. If you change your mind about your guess, you can cycle through your answer by clicking on the color bank until you are back at the first position. Check if your guess is correct by clicking the "Check Guess" button.

NEXT STEPS

The next feature I would add would be a hint button. This button would reveal one of the code elements at random, but at the cost of two of the player's guesses. This would make it easier to guess the code, since the player would only need to match three colors, but would also offset that gained advantage by giving them fewer chances. The overall result would be a slightly easier gameplay. After that it would be interesting to incorporate animations, either for when pegs are added to the board or as a celebratory experience when the code is matched.
