In order to make your guess, select your answer by clicking on the desired color in the bank. Your selection will be added to the guess row. If you change your mind about your guess, you can cycle through your answer by clicking on the color bank until you are back at the first position. Check if your guess is correct by clicking the "Check Guess" button.

NEXT STEP
The next feature I would add is a hint button. This button would reveal one of the code elements at random, but at the cost of one of the player's guesses. This would make it easier to guess, since the player would only need to match three colors, but offset that advantage by giving them fewer chances.
